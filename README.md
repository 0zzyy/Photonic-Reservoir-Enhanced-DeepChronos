# Photonic Reservoir Enhanced DeepChronos

This repository hosts the `photonic_rc_chronos` package which fuses silicon-photonic reservoirs with the (Deepseek LLM and Chronos Time Series) DeepChronos transformer. By pairing an analog photonic reservoir computer with a modern sequence model, the system targets real-time forecasting and telecom equalisation with improved energy efficiency.

A high-level overview of the architecture is provided in `photonic_rc_chronos/docs/architecture.md`. Usage instructions and installation steps can be found in `photonic_rc_chronos/README.md`.
